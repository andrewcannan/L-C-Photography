## Color Palette
Created color palette by taking colors from background image on Contact and Response pages. Used canva.com to generate 4 colors from the image.

## Typography
Used a website called [Fontpair](https://www.fontpair.co/all) to select a font pairing that i thought would work for the site. I chose Montserrat and Hind as they are easily readible and modern but dont distract the visitor away from the main purpose of a photography website which is to display the photographers work.

I chose Vesper Libre for the font for my Headers and Footers as I liked the look of them. 

* [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?query=montserrat)
* [Hind](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind?query=hind)
* [Vesper Libre](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Vesper+Libre?query=vesper)
